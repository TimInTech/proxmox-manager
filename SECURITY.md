## Reporting a Vulnerability

- Please **report privately** via GitHub Security Advisories (Security → Report a vulnerability).
- If advisories are not possible, email `security@example.com` with details.
- Do **not** open public GitHub issues for security bugs; use issues only for non-security problems.
- Include reproduction steps, impact, affected versions/commit, and any suggested mitigation.
- We aim to acknowledge valid reports within 3 business days and share a fix or mitigation plan within 14 days when feasible. Public disclosure happens only after a coordinated fix is available.
