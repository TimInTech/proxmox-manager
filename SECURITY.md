## Reporting a Vulnerability

1. **Do not open a public issue.** Instead, send an email to `security@timintech.com` with the subject `proxmox-manager vulnerability`.
2. Provide a clear description, including reproduction steps, impact, and suggested mitigation if available.
3. You will receive an acknowledgement within 72 hours. We aim to provide a remediation or mitigation plan within 14 days.
4. Once a fix is available, we will coordinate disclosure timing with you before publishing a security advisory.

If you need to transmit sensitive data, ask for a PGP key in your initial email.
